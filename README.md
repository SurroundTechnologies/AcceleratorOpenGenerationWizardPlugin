# OpenGenerationWizardPlugin
Example WizardDefaults plugin class implementations

When creating a new Accelerator system, you can check out a copy of this repository for examples of WizardsDefaults plugins. You will want to create a new class in the GenerationWizardPlugin project, inherit from AB_IGenerationWizardDefault, and implement the interface. (Start with placeholder methods until you know what you need.)

Build the solution to create bin\Debug\GenerationWizardPlugin.dll. The path to that file, and your new class name, must be provided to the Accelerator System Wizard in order to use the plugin during generation.
